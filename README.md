# SDN-Learning-Project

# Aim of This Project (Why)
In this project we want to train good developer habits like clean code principles, design patterns, modular architecture, the use of Behaviour Driven Development (bdd) and Test Driven Devolpment (tdd) methods, all while collaborating through Git and pull requests.

# How We Will Proceed (How)
We will formulate user stories to derive tasks and have a kind of roadmap.
All features will be planned in a modular way so that they can be used independently of each other and the whole app can be extended or changed as needed.

# What We Will Programme (What)
In order to have a real-world context, with many real dependencies, such as databases, authentication, request, persistent data storage and so on, we thought of programming a shopping app.

Features: TBA <-- Breainstorming Session with SDN
